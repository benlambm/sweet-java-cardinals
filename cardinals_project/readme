NEW DATABASE VERSION INSTRUCTIONS:

The Database version (Checkpoint 3) of our JavaSweets application can be started by running the JavaSweetsDriverDB java file.
Please note first though that the database must be imported in MySQL by using the included SQL script 'cardinalsDatabase.sql'.

Our MySQL setup is:
username = itp220
password = itp220
database name = cardinals220

Also, the JavaSweetsDriverDB requires a JDBC driver (mysql_connector_java_5.0.6_bin.jar must be in the classpath).

Enter 1 to make a live connection to the MySQL database

Owner-Login: username is cardinal, password is cardinal [hard-coded in]
Customer-Login: username is guest, password is guest [or create a new one]
