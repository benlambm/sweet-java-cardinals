NEW GUI VERSION INSTRUCTIONS:

The GUI version (Checkpoint 4) of our JavaSweets database application can be started by running the JavaSweetsDriverGUI java file.

Please note first though that the database must be imported in MySQL by using the included SQL script 'cardinalsDatabase.sql'.

Our MySQL setup is:
username = itp220,
password = itp220,
database name = cardinals220

Also, the JavaSweetsDriverDB requires a JDBC driver (mysql_connector_java_5.0.6_bin.jar must be in the classpath).

To login, we have hard-coded this sample login credentials here:
Owner-Login: username is cardinal, password is cardinal
Customer-Login: username is guest, password is guest [or create a new one]


Git integration:
Our source-code repository can be viewed at https://github.com/benlambm/sweet-java-cardinals
